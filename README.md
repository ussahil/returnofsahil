- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m sahil bhandari
      As a skilled data analyst, I am passionate about uncovering insights from complex datasets. With a focus on data analysis, visualization (using tools such as             Seaborn and Tableau), and statistical modeling, I utilize Python and SQL as my primary tools to extract meaningful information from data.
